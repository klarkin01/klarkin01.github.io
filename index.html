                    You can find <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/larkinkyle/">my professional bio</a> on LinkedIn. Please feel free to connect with me! The <em>short</em> version is that I'm an experienced meteorologist, oceanographer, and hydrologist. I'm currently learning Software Development at Boston University's Metropolitan College.

                <h4>Personal info:</h4>
                <p class="matted">
                        In addition to learning, my career, and having a family, I have way too many hobbies and interests. However, two that I have been focused on are weather and genealogy, so I have linked to some related content which may hopefully grow with time.
