                    Like so many others in America, the story of my family's ancestry had become lost through the years and generations after we had been uprooted from Ireland. My grandfather and his siblings knew only vague stories that had been passed down incompletely, but I learned as much as I could. The broad outline was that our ancestors had been pushed westward over time, their land taken from them, until eventually there wasn't enough left to support everyone. But it wasn't "hell or Connacht" for the Larkins; they'd been living there the whole time, but for some reason they still had to move west. It had simply gotten so bad for them that they eventually just left entirely, before the famine even started. They came to the coal mines of Pennsylvania and a life of grinding work, devastating poverty, and injustice, but they had evidently left behind even worse.

                    Anyway, there in the mines, authorities of some sort (perhaps Pinkertons working for the mining company) became aware that the Larkins were involved with the labor movement, and became suspicious of links with the Molly Maguires gang. So it was that my ancestors felt compelled to change their names and become fugitives. Records were purposely obfuscated, and the family moved around alot for many years. Any attempt to trace things back to Ireland had therefore become seemingly impossible, because the critical links in the chain were people who had actively sought to be untraceable. So those were essentially my starting conditions when I began to really investigate the Larkin name.
