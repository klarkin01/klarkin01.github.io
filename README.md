This project is meant to serve as a home for future projects of mine as I continue with my degree and beyond.

One of the projects here is a web-based story of my family history. I have a large family, and I'm sure a lot of my family want to know the story, but I haven't really found a great way to share it. A website always seemed like it would make sense.

I also included weather projects. There is a very high probability that future work for me might include developing tools for displaying weather data (or some kind of geospatial physical data) and providing user controls. So my weather pages implement some basic functions and layouts that can be iterated upon to develop a future platform for hosting in-house weather data. I have to learn how to generate in-house data still, however.

For these pages to really come into their own, it will require the production of a great deal of content (weather data and written content), and my hope is that this will come in time. But for now, I wanted to develop a design and layout that is minimal and easy on the eyes, and I wanted it to have responsive buttons. Above all of that, I wanted it to serve as a sandbox for me to learn how to use development tools.
